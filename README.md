# flutter_counter

Flutter Counter is an example of a simple application that is often used to introduce or learn the basics of developing with Flutter, an open-source framework developed by Google for building user interfaces (UI) quickly and easily, especially for mobile applications. Flutter Counter usually consists of a simple UI display, such as addition and subtraction buttons, and a text or number that displays the amount or count.

A Flutter Counter application usually consists of the following elements:

1. Increment Button: The button used to increase the count.
2. Decrement Button: The button used to reduce the count.
3. Text or Numbers (Counter Display): Part of the UI display that displays the current amount or count.

When the increase button is pressed, the count value will increase, and when the subtraction button is pressed, the count value will decrease. This application is a very simple example to learn basic Flutter concepts such as State Management, Widgets, and Event Handling.
